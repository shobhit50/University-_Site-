<h2 style="padding:10px 0">Programme Overview</h2>
<p><span id="ContentPlaceHolder1_content1">Science: any system of knowledge that is concerned with the physical world and its phenomena and that entails unbiased observations and systematic experimentation. In general, a science involves a pursuit of knowledge covering general truths or the operations of fundamental laws.
Science can be divided into different branches based on the subject of study. The physical sciences study the inorganic world and comprise the fields of astronomy, physics, chemistry, and the Earth sciences. The biological sciences such as biology and medicine study the organic world of life and its processes. Social sciences like anthropology and economics study the social and cultural aspects of human behaviour.
Allied Science: Allied Medical or allied health science courses represent a discipline that involves the study of disease transmission, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation. The allied medical professionals apply scientific principles or evidence-based practices to evaluate and then treat chronic as well as acute diseases. The field is concerned with the promotion of disease prevention, public wellness, improvement of quality of life in terms of health, as well as operation and management of the healthcare system. In addition to this, allied medical courses also deal with all kinds of diagnostic techniques that are crucial for providing the right treatment to patients. Some of the diagnostic techniques used in the medical field include pathological tests, blood analysis, radiography, tissue pathology, etc. Furthermore, unlike the education requirement to become a surgeon or physician the educational qualification for allied medical can ranges from UG/PG degrees to practical training. Many allied medical professionals specialise in the promotion of optimum function and health and the improvement of health-related quality of life. The allied medical professionals include supervisors working in medical laboratories, radio-imaging, neuro-physiology or optical laboratories and paramedical technicians.</span><br /></p>
